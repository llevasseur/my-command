# new (or removed) command can't silently ship half-wired. Runs in PR CI.

#   1. commands/ is byte-in-sync with what build-plugin.sh generates from
#      src/commands/ (the generated namespaced copy was regenerated and committed).
#   2. every src/commands/<name>.md has a docs/features/<name>.md feature doc and a
#      generated commands/<name>.md.
#   3. the install wizard still enumerates src/commands/ dynamically, so new commands
#      are auto-included — guards against someone replacing the glob with a hardcoded
#      list (which is how a new command would silently drop out of the wizard).
