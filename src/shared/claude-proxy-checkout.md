**This command cannot run without claude-proxy**, and its location is not hardcoded — it comes from the environment, exactly as [revive](revive.md) resolves the transcript store.

- **`CLAUDE_PROXY_STORE` (required)** — the directory the proxy writes session transcripts into. Read it from the environment (`printenv CLAUDE_PROXY_STORE`); never guess a path and never derive one from a repo checkout or clone location.
- Derive the two paths the suggestion tooling needs from it: the **log directory** is its parent (the store is `<logDir>/sessions`), and the **claude-proxy checkout** is the directory above that. Confirm the checkout by looking for its `server/package.json`.
- **If `CLAUDE_PROXY_STORE` is unset, or its path is missing, or the derived checkout has no `server/package.json`, stop.** Say which of the three failed, that this command has no suggestions to read without it, and that it must be exported in the shell environment — e.g. in `~/.zshrc`:

  ```sh
  export CLAUDE_PROXY_STORE="$HOME/path/to/claude-proxy/logs/sessions"
  ```

  Do not search the filesystem for a claude-proxy checkout yourself, and do not fall back to a hardcoded path.
- **Where a command declares claude-proxy an _optional_ dependency, those three failures mean it is *absent* rather than that the run is over.** Only a command that says so at its own step, and names what it falls back to, may read them that way; anything that does not say otherwise takes the stop above. **An error is still a stop even then.** A store that exists and fails to read or write is not absence — continuing past it writes a second copy of something that already has one, and two stores that each look complete is worse than no store.
