### Mark each step as you enter it

**Open every step with its marker, on the first line of the message that enters it:** the word `STEP` in capitals, the number written in the `## Step …` heading you are entering, a slash, and how many `## Step …` headings this command declares — `STEP <n>/<N>`. The marker states the step outright, so the record of this run anchors it exactly instead of inferring it from the words around it.

- **Take `<n>` from the heading, not from a count of the steps you have finished.** `## Step 1.5 — …` writes `1.5` and keeps the fraction. A command whose headings start at `## Step 0 — …` writes `0` for its first step. `<N>` is the number of `## Step …` headings in this command, counting a `Step 0` and a `Step 1.5` like any other.
- **A command with no `## Step …` headings has no marker to write.** A single `## Steps` list declares nothing to anchor against, so open those runs in prose alone.
- **Write the marker on entry, once.** Continuing inside a step you already opened writes nothing. Re-entering a step after a correction writes it again, because that is an entry.
- **Keep naming the step in prose as well.** Every run recorded before this marker existed is read from that prose, and the prose is still the only reading for any message the marker is missing from. Dropping it to save a line costs the fallback and buys nothing.
